# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning Models

An automated system that helps users to detect fake news articles.

---


## Overview

This code detects fake news through a text-based analysis, utilizing machine learning models and word embedding techniques. 
Traditional machine learning and deep learning models are trained to classify the text as either fake or true. They are trained individually and as hybrid models.
Accuracy is used to measure the model performance.

## Installation

Be sure to download the dataset and the word embedding technique (GloVe) files before running the code. The code would not be able to run otherwise. 
Due to its large size, the files are only available via the OneDrive links provided in the repository.

Dataset: Download the dataset from "Dataset_onedrive_link.txt".
GloVe: Download the file from "GloVe_onedrive_link.txt".

### NOTE: change the Dataset and GloVe files in the code to your personal path to ensure the code runs.

## Usage

To run the automated system to detect fake news successfully:
1. Download the above files (dataset and GloVe).
2. Download the code ipynb - "Final Code - Detect Fake News.ipynb"
3. Update the file path in parts 1 and 3 of the code.
4. Run the code.
5. Observe the findings.
